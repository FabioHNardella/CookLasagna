# CookLasagna
This is a project in which there's four functions:
1- expectedMinutesInOven: see how many minutes a lasagna is expected to be in the oven;

2- remainingMinutesInOven:insert how many minutes the lasagna has already been on the oven ==>> it'll output how many minutes are left;

3- preparationTimeInMinutes: insert how many layers you put on the lasagna ==>> output how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna ( going by the fact that for every layer is spent 2 minutes )

4- totalTimeInMinutes: insert how many layers you made & how many minutes it has spent on the oven ==>> output the total time spent making the lasagna.
