# CookLasagna
This is a project in which there's four functions:
1- expectedMinutesInOven, where you can see how many minutes a lasagna is expected to be in the oven;

2- remainingMinutesInOven, where you insert how many minutes the lasagna has already been on the oven and it'll output how many minutes are left;

3- preparationTimeInMinutes, where you insert how many layers you put on the lasagna and it'll output how many minutes you spent preparing the lasagna ( goign by the fact that for every layer is spent 2 minutes )

4- totalTimeInMinutes, where you insert how many layers you made and how many minutes it has spent on the oven, it'll output the total time spent making the lasagna.
